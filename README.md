1. Controlling web page behavior. JavaScript allows users to control the behavior of web pages, whether it is creating new elements, displaying or changing data, and responding to user interactions such as clicks or input.

2. Data validation on the client side. JavaScript can be used to validate data entered by users on forms on the client side, thereby reducing the need for communication with the server and improving the user experience.

3. Manipulate and arrange page elements. JavaScript allows users to change, manipulate, and organize elements on web pages, such as creating animations, adding interactivity, or changing element attribute values.

4. Use of frameworks and libraries. JavaScript has many custom frameworks and libraries that users can use to speed up and simplify the web application development process.
